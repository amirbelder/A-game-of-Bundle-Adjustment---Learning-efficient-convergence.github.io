            <p>Bundle adjustment is the common way to solve localization and mapping. It is an iterative process in which a system of non-linear equations is solved using two optimization methods, weighted by a damping factor. In the classic approach, the latter is chosen heuristically by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on each iteration. This might take many iterations, making the process computationally expensive, which might be harmful to real-time applications. We propose to replace this heuristic by viewing the problem in a holistic manner, as a game, and formulating it as a reinforcement-learning task. We set an environment which solves the non-linear equations and train an agent to choose the damping factor in a learned manner. We demonstrate that our approach considerably reduces the number of iterations required to reach the bundle adjustment's convergence, on both synthetic and real-life scenarios. We show that this reduction benefits the classic approach and can be integrated with other bundle adjustment acceleration methods.

            <h1>Contributions</h1>
            <p>This paper makes the following contributions: We propose a general and unified approach that learns the ideal value of Î». It can be integrated within other
BA acceleration methods.
2. We propose a network that utilizes this approach using
Reinforcement Learning. We show that it achieves a
significant reduction in the number of iterations and
running time. On the KITTI benchmark for instance,
a 1/5 of the iterations were required, which led to an
overall speedup of 3. </p>
